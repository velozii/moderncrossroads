# moderncrossroads
My second project on this game. I don't feel like giving up just yet, so I'll try to release more updates and features, toggles etc.
I'm still learning coding, so you might see some AI comments being used, Let me take my path in making something, and you take yours. I plan to release some features where if you reload with crossbow, you won't get slowed down, and possibly a crossbow auto-reload for that matter aswell.
# Thank you.
